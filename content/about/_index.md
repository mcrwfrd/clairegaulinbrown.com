Hi! Thank you for visiting my site:) My name is Claire and I am a self taught artist living and working on Vancouver Island, British-Columbia. I work with watercolour, gouache, and pen and ink, and much of my work involves looking at the interconnectivity of human and animals. I aim to depict these connections as beautiful, destructive, hopeful, and helpless. I am using my artistic voice to speak up about the environmental crisis that we face today, and hopefully you will think differently about the world and our place within it by my little worlds. My work is often described as whimsical, but don't be fooled by my colours, you can after find macabre undertones in order to bring these faces of conflict and connections to life.

When I am not painting you can find me running trails, logging carbonless miles surfing along the coast, and cooking delicious plant based meals with my developer husband!

I love hearing from you! Don't hesitate to reach out, seriously:)

xx
