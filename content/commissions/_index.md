I am currently accepting commissions! There are many different options for you to have a painting commissioned, if you have animals or themes in mind we can work together to create a general idea of the finished product. Or choose to be surprised, which is always an exciting option! If you are interested in commissioning a painting, please pop me an email with the size you are hoping for as well as any particular ideas and I will get back to you with a quote as soon as possible!

Please allow 4-6 weeks for me to complete the painting, but if you are on a tight timeline let me know and we can work something out.

Keep in mind that I predominantly draw flora and fauna, so I might not be your girl if you are looking for a cityscape or portrait painting. Feel free to browse through my work to get a feel for my style and see if it would suit your needs:)
